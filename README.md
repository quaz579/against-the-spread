## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
- [Azurite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) (for local development)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/against-the-spread.git
   cd against-the-spread
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Start Azurite (local storage emulator)**
   ```bash
   azurite --silent --location /tmp/azurite
   ```

4. **Run Azure Functions locally**
   ```bash
   cd src/AgainstTheSpread.Functions
   func start
   ```

5. **Run Blazor Web App** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd src/AgainstTheSpread.Web
   dotnet run
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   - Web App: http://localhost:5000
   - API: http://localhost:7071

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with coverage
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverageReportsDir=./coverage
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

- **Unit Tests**: All business logic in Core library
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with Azurite
- **Component Tests**: Blazor components with bUnit
- **E2E Tests**: Full user flows

### Test Coverage Goals
- Core Library: >90%
- Functions: >80%
- Web Components: >70%

## 🚢 Deployment

### Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
```

### Deploy Application

Deployments are automated via GitHub Actions on merge to `main`.

Manual deployment:
```bash
# Deploy Functions
cd src/AgainstTheSpread.Functions
func azure functionapp publish <function-app-name>

# Deploy Web App
cd src/AgainstTheSpread.Web
dotnet publish -c Release
# Upload to Azure Static Web Apps
```

## 📱 PWA Installation

### iOS (Safari)
1. Open the app in Safari
2. Tap the Share button
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add"

### Android (Chrome)

./infrastructure/scripts/upload-lines.sh path/to/Week1.xlsx 1
```

**Option 2: Using Azure CLI directly**
```bash
az storage blob upload \
  --account-name <storage-account-name> \
  --container-name gamefiles \
  --name "lines/week-1.xlsx" \
  --file "Week 1 Lines.xlsx" \
  --auth-mode login
```

### User: Make Picks

- No authentication required for MVP (trust-based)

## 💰 Cost Analysis

Running on Azure free tier:
- **Azure Functions**: Free (1M executions/month)
- **Static Web Apps**: Free (100GB bandwidth/month)
- **Blob Storage**: ~$0.02-0.10/month

**Total Monthly Cost**: Effectively FREE
