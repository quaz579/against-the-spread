## Agent Instructions

### When Building Features

1. **Always start with tests**: Write failing tests first (TDD approach)
2. **Compile frequently**: After each significant change, compile to catch errors early
3. **Run tests frequently**: After implementing code, run tests to validate
4. **Small commits**: Make small, logical commits with clear messages
5. **Documentation**: Update README/docs as you build features

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- All business logic in Core library
- All service methods in Functions
- All utility functions
- Mock external dependencies (Blob Storage, HTTP)

**Integration Tests:**
- API endpoints with Azurite
- Excel parsing with real sample files
- Excel generation with validation

**Component Tests:**
- Blazor components with bUnit
- User interaction flows
- Form validation

**Test Naming Convention:**
```csharp
[Fact]
public void MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior()
{
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
}
```

### Build & Test Commands

**Restore and Build:**
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

**Run All Tests:**
```bash
dotnet test
```

**Run Specific Test Project:**
```bash
dotnet test src/AgainstTheSpread.Tests/AgainstTheSpread.Tests.csproj
```

**Run with Coverage:**
```bash
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverageReportsDir=./coverage
```

**Run Azure Functions Locally:**
```bash
cd src/AgainstTheSpread.Functions
func start
```

**Run Blazor WASM Locally:**
```bash
cd src/AgainstTheSpread.Web
dotnet run
```

### Terraform Commands

**Initialize:**
```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
```

**Plan (Dev):**
```bash
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
```

**Apply (Dev):**
```bash
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
```

**Destroy (Dev):**
```bash
terraform destroy -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Monorepo Structure
- Single repository for frontend, backend, infrastructure, and tests
- Simplifies versioning and deployment
- Easier CI/CD configuration

### 2. Shared Core Library
- `AgainstTheSpread.Core` contains models, interfaces, and utilities
- Referenced by both Functions and Web projects
- Ensures type safety across the stack

### 3. Excel Processing Strategy
- Admin uploads Excel → Parse to JSON → Store in Blob
- User selects games → Generate Excel from template → Download
- Keep original Excel as backup in Blob Storage

### 4. Authentication Strategy
- MVP: No authentication (trust-based)
- Future: Azure AD B2C for user management
- Admin endpoints can be protected with function keys initially

### 5. Storage Strategy
```
Blob Container: gamefiles
├── lines/
│   ├── week-1.xlsx          # Original uploaded file
│   ├── week-1.json          # Parsed game data
│   ├── week-2.xlsx
│   └── week-2.json
└── picks/                    # Optional: store submitted picks
    ├── week-1/
    │   ├── user1.xlsx
    │   └── user2.xlsx
    └── week-2/
```

### 6. API Endpoints

**Admin:**
- `POST /api/admin/lines/{week}` - Upload weekly lines Excel
- `GET /api/admin/lines` - List all available weeks

**User:**
- `GET /api/lines/{week}` - Get games for specific week
- `GET /api/lines/current` - Get games for current week
- `POST /api/picks` - Submit picks and generate Excel download

## Error Handling Strategy

### API Level
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include descriptive error messages
- Log errors to Application Insights

### Frontend Level
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Show loading states during API calls

### Validation
- Validate exactly 6 picks selected
- Validate week number exists
- Validate Excel file format on upload

## Testing with Sample Data

Use the reference documents in `reference-docs/`:
- `Week 1 Lines.xlsx` - Sample input for admin upload
- `Week 2 Lines.xlsx` - Second week sample
- `Weekly Picks Example.xlsx` - Expected output format

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path**: Upload week 1 lines → Select 6 games → Download picks Excel
2. **Validation**: Try to select fewer/more than 6 games
3. **Error Handling**: Upload invalid Excel format
4. **Mobile**: Test PWA installation and usage on mobile
5. **Concurrent Users**: Multiple users selecting games simultaneously

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend
- Lazy load components where possible
- Cache game data in browser storage
- Minimize bundle size

### Backend
- Use streaming for Excel generation (large files)
- Cache parsed game data (avoid re-parsing Excel)
- Set appropriate CORS policies

### Storage
- Use Blob Storage SAS tokens for direct download
- Set appropriate cache headers
- Compress Excel files if needed

## Security Considerations

### MVP (No Auth)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Validate all inputs
- Function keys for admin endpoints
- CORS configuration

### Future (With Auth)
- Azure AD B2C integration
- Role-based access (Admin vs User)
- Audit logging for admin actions
- User-specific pick history

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Development**: Used for feature development and testing
2. **Production**: Live application for all users

### Deployment Process
1. Commit code to feature branch
2. Create PR → GitHub Actions runs build/test
3. Merge to main → GitHub Actions deploys to dev
4. Manual approval → Deploy to production

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep previous Terraform state
- Tag releases in GitHub
- Easy rollback via Terraform or Azure Portal

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Insights
- Track API request/response times
- Monitor error rates
- Track custom events (uploads, downloads)

### Alerts
- Set up alerts for high error rates
- Monitor storage usage
- Track function execution failures

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **User Authentication**: Azure AD B2C
2. **Pick History**: Show user's past picks and results
3. **Leaderboard**: Track weekly winners and total wins
4. **Automated Scoring**: Parse game results and calculate winners
5. **Push Notifications**: Remind users to submit picks
6. **Bowl Games**: Confidence points system
7. **Playoff Bracket**: Tournament-style picks
8. **Admin Dashboard**: View all submissions, generate reports
9. **Mobile Apps**: Native iOS/Android using .NET MAUI

## Agent Checkpoints

After completing each phase:
1. ✅ Run `dotnet build` - ensure compilation succeeds
2. ✅ Run `dotnet test` - ensure all tests pass
3. ✅ Test locally - validate functionality works as expected
4. ✅ Commit changes with descriptive message
5. ✅ Update this document if any decisions changed

## Questions to Address During Development

- Should we store submitted picks in Blob Storage or just generate on-the-fly?
- Do we need to track who submitted picks for the current week?
- Should the admin be able to edit/delete uploaded weeks?
- What happens if someone tries to download picks before lines are uploaded?
- Should we validate that the uploaded Excel matches the expected format strictly?

## Success Criteria

The MVP is complete when:
- ✅ Admin can upload weekly lines via web interface
- ✅ User can view available games on mobile
- ✅ User can select exactly 6 games
- ✅ User can download Excel file in correct format
- ✅ PWA is installable on mobile devices
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Infrastructure is deployed via Terraform
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys to dev
- ✅ Application is accessible via public URL
- ✅ Costs remain in free tier or near-zero

**Remember**: Build incrementally, test frequently, commit often. Focus on making the MVP work perfectly before adding enhancements.
