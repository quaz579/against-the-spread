Here are the rules:
**
Submitting Picks**
I use a spreadsheet to submit picks. I WILL NOT accept picks if they aren't in the spreadsheet. It is way too much work to input everyone's picks manually. Also, I WILL NOT accept picks after the cut-off time.
Fee & Pay-Out

The cost is $110. 14 weeks x $5 = $70, $10 for most wins, $10 for Playoff bracket and $20 for bowls.
Each week I pull $5 of your money and multiple that by the number of people and that is the weekly payout. Ex; 100 people x $5 = $500 weekly payout. I don't pay a fee and will cap at 101 so we can have weekly pot of $500. The 1st 100 to pay are in.
$10 per person goes to the total wins pot. Ex; 100 people x $10 = $1,000 payout. Only regular season (14 weeks) count towards total wins.
$20 per person goes to the bowl pot. The person with the most confidence points wins $10 x the number of participants and the person who wins the most games against the spread wins $10 x the number of participants.
$10 per person goes into the Playoff Bracket pool
Weekly Rules

All picks are due Thursday night by kick-off of the game. If there are games earlier in the week, and you want to pick those games, I need that pick before kick-off of that game, all other picks are due THURSDAY.
Each person picks 5 or 6 games against the spread. You must win all of your picks to qualify for the payout. If a person picks 5 and wins all 5, and a person picks 6 and wins all 6, the person who picks 6 wins the pot, sorry 5 person winner, should have pressed your luck
If 2 or more people win all of their picks the pot is split
If no one wins all of their picks the pot carries over
